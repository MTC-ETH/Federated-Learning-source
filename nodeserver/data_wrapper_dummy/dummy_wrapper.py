"""
Dummy Data Wrapper to stream training data to the node client

This scripts provides an endpoint callable by all containers in the docker network "webnet" via tcp.
On startup, it fetches the dummy train & test data from an S3 bucket and transforms it into jsonlines.
The the callable routes '/train' & '/test' stream the fetched data line by line (i.e. json by json).
